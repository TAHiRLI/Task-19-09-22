                <h3>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h3>
                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting <br>
                    industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy <br>
                    text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley <br>
                    of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived<br>
                     not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, <br>
                     remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the<br>
                      release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more <br>
                      recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker <br>
                      including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                <h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
                <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the <br>
                    readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of <br>
                    using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution <br>
                    of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making<br>
                     it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and<br>
                      web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,<br>
                       and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still <br>
                       in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, <br>
                       sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and<br>
                        the like).</p>

                <h3>Where does it come from?</h3>
                <p>
                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply <br>
                     random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin<br>
                     literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard<br>
                       McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia<br>
                    , looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from<br>
                      a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word<br>
                      literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes sections<br>
                     1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" <br>
                      by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics<br>
                      popular during the Renaissance. The first, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit <br>
                      amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. <br>
                      
                      The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced <br>
                       below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de <br>
                       Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their<br>
                        exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the<br>
                         1914 translation by H. Rackham.<br>

                <h3>Where can I get some?</h3>
                <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum <br>
                    available, but the majority have suffered alteration<br>
                     in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which<br>
                      don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use <br>
                      a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't <br>
                      anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem <br>
                      Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined <br>
                      chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on <br>
                      the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, <br>
                      therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or <br>
                      non-characteristic words etc. <br>

                      dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful <br>
                      of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which<br>
                      looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always<br>
                      free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic<br>
                      words etc.<br>
